Our photo booth journey began in March 2019, when Fresno Ideaworks joined the global celebration of the Raspberry Pi Big Birthday Weekend—a worldwide event marking the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s sixth anniversary. Over 100 Raspberry JAMs were held across 40 countries, and we hosted one right here in Fresno.
To make our JAM extra special, we built a photo booth inspired by Ben Nuttall’s jam-photobooth project, created specifically for the Big Birthday Weekend. Ben, a Raspberry Pi Community Manager at the time, published the project to GitHub as part of the official JAM kit.
The booth featured:
- A big arcade-style button to trigger the camera.
- A countdown timer displayed on screen.
- Four quick photos taken in sequence.
- A themed overlay with the Big Birthday Weekend logo.
- Automatic posting to Twitter with hashtags like #PiParty and #RJam.

We customized the overlay for our Fresno JAM and added a few tweaks to suit our setup. The booth was a hit—visitors loved it, and the instant social media sharing added a fun, tech-savvy twist to the event.

You can see examples from our booth and similar booths from other events in the official Raspberry Pi blog post:

Over the years, we reused the booth for events like ArtHop and our 10th anniversary celebration in 2022 (see above). But by 2025, the original system was outdated—prompting a full rebuild with modern hardware, updated libraries, and new social media integrations.
